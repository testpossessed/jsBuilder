### jsBuilder
A utility library for creating test JavaScript objects inspired by [NBuilder](https://github.com/garethdown44/nbuilder/) my preferred .NET test data builder.

#### Installing

jsBuilder is designed to work in browsers with or without RequireJS or with Node.js.  It hasn't been fully tested with RequireJS as I don't use it myself, but I hope to do more testing with it at some point.

Install with npm
```
npm install jsbuilder --save-dev
```

Install with bower
```
bower install jsBuilder --save-dev
```

Install with NuGet

To install with NuGet search for jsBuilder or use Package Manager Console to execute
```
Install-Package jsBuilder
```

#### Usage
